## Shopping application on Android
<br>*As of now some changes are being made to the app. Work under progress*
<br><br>
This is a pure Android application. <br>
It has the following features.
* Firebase based Authentication. <br>
* Displays the list of products as available in the Firebase database.
   
* Has a shopping cart.

The APK Folder contains a sample APK, but it will not display any images next to the products 
because the server.py Imageserver should be running. <br>
\

<br><br>

### NOTE 
* The **images should be named with the corresponding product ID**, and **jpg format** is preferred. <br>
* You need to register the application imported to Android studio with Firebase.<br>

Feel free to add more features, like search functionality, and sorting/filtering the items, categorizing them into different categories based on the type, etc ...
